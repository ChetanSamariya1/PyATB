1) Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
Ans: The = operator is used to assign a value to a variable.
The == operator is used to compare two values to check if they are equal.
It returns True if the values on both sides of the operator are equal, otherwise, it returns False.
In summary, = is for assigning values, while == is for comparing values to determine equality.

2) What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
Ans: In Python, the ** operator is used for exponentiation,
meaning it raises a number to the power of another number.
Example: result = 2 ** 3  # 2 raised to the power of 3 (2^3)
print(result)  # Output: 8

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
Ans: In Python, the ^ operator is a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator.
It performs an XOR operation between the corresponding bits of two integers.
The XOR operation compares corresponding bits of two numbers:
If the bits are the same (both 0 or both 1), the result is 0.
If the bits are different (one is 0 and the other is 1), the result is 1.
