# for i in range(1, 10, 1): # start 1 to stop 10-1= 9, step = 1
#     print(i)
# output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# By default end of the line in loop will be new line. We can change it

# for x in range(1, 7, 1):
#     print(x, end=" ")  # Now output will be in same line with space

for j in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(j, end=" ")
